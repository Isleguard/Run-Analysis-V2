 steps to perform
1. remove "..."   --> sub ("...", "", names)  should remove the three dots

2. tolower (names)   ---> make all case letters lower case

3. remove strings that contain "avg" or "sd"

4. the data from #3 is used within the dplyr functin "filter" to remove those columns

5. count the number of columns,

6.update the word document.
7.update the command string document.
8. go to git-hub and remove unnecessary files
9. put the new data out to the git-hub account.

10.submit the work for grading

*************************************************************************
2nd attempt

1. use grepl to determine the column names that contain "mean,std,correlation,
mad(?),max,min, ....iqr(?), sma, energy, entropy

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.


may be easier to grab what is desired...for the final dataset.
