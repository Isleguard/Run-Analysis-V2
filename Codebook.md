Dataset Background Information (from the website:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#

Data Set Information (from the original dataset):

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Dataset Information:
I used the labels provided with the data sets for the columnar labels;
File:  features.txt 
I used the labels provided with the dataset for the row labels but placed them in column 1 because there were similar type of labels that are disallowed being used as row labels;
	File: activity_labels.txt

For the new tidy dataset, the same labels were used for the columnar labels
The activity labels were converted from the numbers (again) to text and modified to 

Row Labels:
1.	Walking_mean:  The average of all the columnar data feature labeled “Walking”
2.	Walking_sd:  The sd of all the columnar data feature labeled “Walking”
3.	Walking_up_mean:  The average of the walking upstairs data
4.	Walking_up_sd:  The standard deviation of the walking upstairs data
5.	Walking_dn_mean:  The average of the walking down stairs data
6.	Walking_dn_sd:  The standard deviation of the walking down stairs data
7.	Standing_mean:  The average of the columnar data feature labeled standing
8.	Standing_sd:  The standard deviation of all the columnar data for standing
9.	Sitting_mean:  The average of all the columnar data feature labeled sitting
10.	Sitting_sd:  The standard deviation of all the marked columnar data for sitting
11.	Laying_mean:  The average of all the columnar data feature labeled laying
12.	Laying_sd:  The standard deviation of all the columnar data featured labeled laying
13.	Total_mean:  The mean of all the data from each column
14.	Total_sd:  The standard deviation of all the data from each column.


There are several code samples used in the “run-analysis.R” routine.
1.	Compute_activity.R:  This routine computes the values for the tidy dataset.
2.	Compute.R:  This routine computes the total mean and sd across all the dataset
3.	Codetest:R:  used to help generate the initial row and columnar data labels
4.	Codetest_train.R:  Used to help generate the row and columnar data labels.
5.	Run_analysis.R: The final code that implements the above files.

Output data:
Train_and_test.csv:  the original datasets combined
Tidy.txt:  The tidy dataset for the project
